In a world of constant change and growing environmental challenges, there are still individuals who choose to return — not for luxury, but for hope. This is the story of someone who went back to his roots, bringing not only knowledge, but also love, time, and the courage to listen. 

A story about how great change can begin from something simple — from a humble mat, a cup of warm coffee, and a willingness to be fully present.

I never truly knew when my love for the forest began. Perhaps it was when the smell of wet soil first greeted my senses, or when the wind’s whisper through the leaves invited me closer to nature. But maybe that seed of love was planted long before I understood its meaning when my childhood village, once surrounded by thick forest, slowly fell silent. The trees disappeared, landslides came uninvited, and the songs of birds were replaced by the roar of chainsaws. A memory I can never forget — and perhaps never forgive.

I am a forester — a simple word, but one that carries immense responsibility and deep honor.  
This profession is not just about planting trees or guarding the forest. It is a mission to bridge two great entities: humanity and nature. Amid the tension between livelihood and sustainability, that is where I stand among roots that grip the soil and the unyielding dreams of the people.

My journey began in college, at the University of Lampung. The Faculty of Forestry gave me not only knowledge but awareness. I learned about conservation, management, and cultivation but outside the classroom, I learned something even more important: to listen. From student organizations and long discussions with communities, I realized that change does not come from theory, but from the courage to show up and listen.

After graduation, fate brought me to the **Rainforest Alliance** — an organization that allowed me to work among roots and leaves, between conflict and hope. And more than that, it gave me a reason to return home.

In 2019, a turning point came.  I returned to my hometown, Tanggamus Regency, Lampung — not just as a forester, but as a son of the village longing to reconnect with his land. In **Pekon Sedayu**, I saw wounds unseen on any map:  protected forests turned into coffee fields, wild elephants losing their way and entering villages, and people caught between today’s survival and tomorrow’s sustainability.

I didn’t come with answers — I came with time. I sat with them, drinking coffee on simple mats, and listened.  Listened to their worries, fears, and hopes. I realized that solutions cannot be forced; they must grow from shared understanding.  With the support of **Rainforest Alliance** and **UPTD KPH Kota Agung Utara**,  we began something small yet brave: forming **Gapoktanhut Lestari Sejahtera** — a community forest farmers’ group.

The process was far from easy.  Long debates, exhausting participatory mapping, and endless technical training tested our patience. But slowly, hope began to grow.

Finally, on **December 19, 2019**,  the Ministry of Environment and Forestry issued a **Community Forest Permit (IUPHKm)**  for Gapoktanhut Lestari Sejahtera.  That day, I saw faces filled with hope.  But I knew — the permit was not the end, only the beginning:  a doorway to new challenges Maintaining commitment, nurturing trust, and building independence.

Another challenge came in 2020.  We received a **land rehabilitation program** from **One Tree Planted (OTP)** with an ambitious target: planting 100,000 trees, including 30,000 bamboo. But the community refused to plant bamboo for them, bamboo was a pest to coffee, not a savior of forests.

We didn’t force them.  We returned to our core method — listening.  We met them, discussed late into the night, not just speaking but truly listening. Gradually, understanding grew.  Members of Gapoktanhut Lestari Sejahtera began to see  that this wasn’t about a planting project, but an investment in the future — for generations to come.

When the planting began, nearly all members joined.  I saw cooperation that had almost vanished come alive again on the mountain slopes.  I saw children planting seedlings, and I knew — this was more than conservation.  It was a movement for life.

Even as hope grew, challenges remained.  Elephants still came into farms — but now the farmers had changed.  They no longer chased them away; they understood that space must be shared. I still remember when **Pak Sugriwo** said,  “If we protect the forest, the elephants will not be angry That sentence was more than words — it was a philosophy of life.

Eventually, the community asked me to become a **forestry officer**.  They wanted me to be closer more “official.”  I hesitated at first, but in the end, I applied to become a **civil servant (ASN)** not to leave, but to strengthen.

When I was accepted and appointed as an ASN,  I knew it was part of a destiny written with the hopes of many.  Now, as a forestry extension officer at **Resort Semaka Hilir, UPTD KPH Kota Agung Utara**, I manage not only trees — but dreams.  I protect not only forests — but the hopes of the people.

To be a forester is to be a bridge —  a bridge connecting a wounded past with a brighter future. I believe that as long as there is one person willing to sit on the same mat and listen,  the forest will continue to live.

But times change.  Today, the greatest challenge is not only planting trees — but planting **data**.  In the digital era, information is key.  Unfortunately, data from forest farmer groups (KTH) are often scattered, incomplete, or lost.  Without data, how can we plan for the future?

From this concern, **RUMAH PETAni** was born — not merely a platform, but a *digital home* for hope and potential,  powered by geospatial technology and the **KoboToolbox** system.  We began to collect data with precision —  interactive maps, farmer profiles, and non-timber forest product data — now everything is clear and open to everyone.

One of **RUMAH PETAni’s** proudest achievements  is the success of **participatory mapping**  in KTH Tumpak Rejo 1, 2, 3, and Gapoktanhut Lestari Sejahtera.  The process did not just produce maps — it created a new culture.  Farmers no longer talk only about harvests and fertilizers;  they now talk about coordinates and geo-tagging.

This transformation is remarkable.  Those who once feared gadgets now use them to map their land. Young people now see forestry officers not as bureaucrats, but as visionary partners.

For forestry officers, **RUMAH PETAni** has become a revolutionary tool — no more worn-out notebooks; all data is now at their fingertips.  For farmers, it is a tool of advocacy —  a way to show their contribution concretely.  For the wider public, it is true transparency.  But most importantly, this platform humanizes data — behind every point on the map lies a story, a family, and a struggle.

I believe **RUMAH PETAni** represents the future.  If this platform is widely adopted,  it’s not impossible that every KTH in Indonesia will have an accurate, open database.  From there, forest management can become more democratic, inclusive, and humane.  Because forests are not only about ecosystems —  they are about the people who live within and around them.  And technology, when used with heart,  can become the bridge between the two.

To close this story, I want to invite everyone who reads this:  Never underestimate the power of listening.  Never take for granted the act of sitting together on the same mat —  for from there, change begins, and from there, trust grows.

I am no one special — just a village boy given the chance to return.  But I believe:  as long as our hearts remain with the forest,  hope will never fade. 🌿
